# CI/CD Pipeline

## Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) are practices that help teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. This guide covers the fundamentals of CI/CD pipelines and their implementation.

## What is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Frequent code integration
- Automated builds
- Automated testing
- Early bug detection
- Code quality checks

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Automated deployment preparation
- Manual approval for production
- Consistent deployment process
- Environment management
- Release automation

### Continuous Deployment
- Fully automated deployment
- No manual intervention
- Production-ready code
- Automated rollback
- Feature flags

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Source Control
- Git repository
- Branch management
- Code review
- Merge policies
- Version control

### 2. Build Stage
- Code compilation
- Dependency management
- Artifact creation
- Version tagging
- Build optimization

### 3. Test Stage
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing
- Security scanning

### 4. Deploy Stage
- Environment provisioning
- Configuration management
- Deployment automation
- Health checks
- Rollback procedures

## Implementation

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    - name: Deploy
      run: npm run deploy
```

### GitLab CI Example
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .
    - docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=$DOCKER_IMAGE
```

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- Keep pipelines fast
- Use caching
- Parallel execution
- Conditional stages
- Environment variables

### Security
- Secret management
- Access control
- Security scanning
- Dependency checking
- Compliance validation

### Monitoring
- Pipeline metrics
- Build times
- Test coverage
- Deployment frequency
- Failure rates

## Common Tools

### CI/CD Platforms
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Travis CI

### Testing Tools
- JUnit
- Selenium
- Jest
- Cypress
- SonarQube

### Deployment Tools
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Helm

## Advanced Topics

### Feature Flags
- Gradual rollout
- A/B testing
- Feature toggles
- Canary releases
- Dark launches

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy new version
2. Test in production
3. Switch traffic
4. Monitor
5. Rollback if needed

### Canary Releases
1. Deploy to subset
2. Monitor metrics
3. Gradual rollout
4. Full deployment
5. Cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Deployment errors
- Environment issues
- Performance problems

### Debugging
- Log analysis
- Environment checks
- Dependency verification
- Configuration review
- Network testing
