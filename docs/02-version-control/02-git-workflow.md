# GitHub/GitLab Workflow

## Introduction
A Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. This guide covers common workflows used in GitHub and GitLab environments.

## Common Workflows

### 1. Centralized Workflow
- Single main branch (master/main)
- All developers work directly on main branch
- Simple and straightforward
- Best for small teams

### 2. Feature Branch Workflow
- Main branch remains stable
- New features developed in separate branches
- Pull requests for code review
- Better for team collaboration

### 3. Gitflow Workflow
- Strict branching model
- Multiple branch types:
  - master/main
  - develop
  - feature
  - release
  - hotfix
- Suitable for larger projects

### 4. Forking Workflow
- Each developer has their own server-side repository
- No direct access to main repository
- Changes submitted via pull requests
- Common in open-source projects

## GitHub/GitLab Features

### Pull Requests
- Code review
- Discussion
- Continuous integration
- Merge checks
- Issue linking

### Issues
- Bug tracking
- Feature requests
- Task management
- Milestone planning
- Labels and assignees

### Projects
- Kanban boards
- Task organization
- Progress tracking
- Team collaboration
- Sprint planning

## Best Practices

### Repository Setup
- Initialize with README
- Add .gitignore
- Set up branch protection
- Configure CI/CD
- Add contribution guidelines

### Branch Naming
- feature/feature-name
- bugfix/bug-description
- hotfix/issue-description
- release/version-number
- docs/documentation-update

### Commit Messages
- Follow conventional commits
- Reference issues
- Keep messages clear
- Use present tense
- Limit line length

### Code Review
- Review all changes
- Check for bugs
- Verify tests
- Ensure documentation
- Consider performance

## Common Operations

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Push to remote
4. Create pull request
5. Request review
6. Address feedback
7. Merge when approved

### Managing Issues
1. Create issue
2. Add description
3. Assign labels
4. Assign to team member
5. Link to project
6. Track progress
7. Close when resolved

### Code Review Process
1. Review code changes
2. Check test coverage
3. Verify documentation
4. Comment on issues
5. Request changes if needed
6. Approve when satisfied

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### GitLab CI
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
```

## Security Best Practices

### Repository Security
- Enable 2FA
- Use SSH keys
- Regular security audits
- Dependency scanning
- Secret scanning

### Access Control
- Role-based access
- Branch protection
- Code review requirements
- Merge restrictions
- Environment protection
