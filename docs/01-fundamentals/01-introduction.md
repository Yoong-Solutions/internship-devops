# Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It's not just a set of tools, but a culture and philosophy that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between developers and operations teams.

## Why DevOps?
- Faster time to market
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Increased reliability and stability
- Better security
- Cost reduction
- Continuous improvement

## DevOps Culture
- Collaboration between Development and Operations
- Shared responsibility
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Automation mindset
- Customer-centric approach

## DevOps Lifecycle
1. **Plan**: Project planning and requirements gathering
2. **Code**: Software development and version control
3. **Build**: Continuous integration and build automation
4. **Test**: Automated testing and quality assurance
5. **Release**: Release management and deployment
6. **Deploy**: Infrastructure provisioning and application deployment
7. **Operate**: System monitoring and maintenance
8. **Monitor**: Performance monitoring and feedback

## Key DevOps Practices
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Configuration Management
- Automated Testing
- Monitoring and Logging
- Microservices Architecture
- Containerization

## DevOps Tools Overview
- Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack
