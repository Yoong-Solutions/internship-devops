# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

## Overview
The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. In a DevOps environment, SDLC is optimized for speed and efficiency while maintaining quality.

## Traditional SDLC vs DevOps SDLC

### Traditional SDLC
- Waterfall approach
- Sequential phases
- Long development cycles
- Limited feedback
- Separate teams for development and operations

### DevOps SDLC
- Agile approach
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Short development cycles
- Continuous feedback
- Collaborative teams

## DevOps SDLC Phases

### 1. Planning
- Requirements gathering
- Project scope definition
- Resource allocation
- Timeline planning
- Risk assessment

### 2. Development
- Code writing
- Code review
- Version control
- Branch management
- Pair programming

### 3. Testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### 4. Deployment
- Environment setup
- Configuration management
- Release management
- Deployment automation
- Rollback procedures

### 5. Operations
- System monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Security monitoring
- Incident management
- System maintenance

### 6. Feedback
- User feedback
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- Continuous improvement

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use version control
- Implement code reviews
- Follow coding standards
- Write automated tests
- Use feature branches

### Testing
- Implement test automation
- Use continuous testing
- Perform security testing
- Conduct performance testing
- Maintain test environments

### Deployment
- Use deployment automation
- Implement blue-green deployment
- Use canary releases
- Maintain deployment documentation
- Monitor deployment metrics

### Operations
- Implement monitoring
- Use log management
- Set up alerting
- Maintain system documentation
- Regular system updates

## Tools and Technologies

### Development
- Git
- GitHub/GitLab
- IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Code quality tools

### Testing
- JUnit
- Selenium
- JMeter
- SonarQube

### Deployment
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Ansible

### Operations
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- ELK Stack
- Nagios

## Metrics and KPIs
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery
- Change failure rate
- Application performance
- User satisfaction
