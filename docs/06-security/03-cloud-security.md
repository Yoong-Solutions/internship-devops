# Cloud Security

## Introduction
Cloud Security is a set of practices, technologies, and policies to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud environments.

## Why Cloud Security?
- Data protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Risk management
- Environment security
- Access control

## Core Concepts

### Shared Responsibility
- Cloud Provider
- Customer
- Infrastructure
- Platform
- Application

### Security Controls
- Identity & Access
- Network Security
- Data Protection
- Compliance
- Monitoring

## Security Controls

### Identity & Access
```yaml
# iam-policy.yml
policies:
  - name: "User Access"
    rules:
      - "MFA required"
      - "Strong passwords"
      - "Role-based access"
  - name: "Service Access"
    rules:
      - "Least privilege"
      - "Regular review"
      - "Access logging"
```

### Network Security
```yaml
# network-security.yml
security:
  vpc:
    - "Private subnets"
    - "Public subnets"
    - "NAT gateways"
  security_groups:
    - "Inbound rules"
    - "Outbound rules"
    - "Stateful filtering"
  network_acls:
    - "Subnet level"
    - "Stateless rules"
    - "Default deny"
```

## Security Policies

### Data Protection
```yaml
# data-protection.yml
policies:
  - name: "Encryption"
    rules:
      - "At rest"
      - "In transit"
      - "Key management"
  - name: "Backup"
    rules:
      - "Regular backups"
      - "Cross-region"
      - "Retention policy"
```

### Compliance
```yaml
# compliance.yml
policies:
  - name: "Data Privacy"
    rules:
      - "GDPR"
      - "CCPA"
      - "Data residency"
  - name: "Security Standards"
    rules:
      - "ISO 27001"
      - "SOC 2"
      - "PCI DSS"
```

## Security Monitoring

### Cloud Monitoring
```yaml
# cloud-monitoring.yml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - "Resource usage"
    - "Network traffic"
    - "API calls"
    - "Cost metrics"
  alerts:
    - name: "High Usage"
      threshold: "80%"
    - name: "Cost Alert"
      threshold: "budget"
```

### Security Logging
```yaml
# security-logging.yml
logging:
  services:
    - "CloudTrail"
    - "CloudWatch"
    - "VPC Flow Logs"
  retention: "365d"
  analysis:
    - "Real-time"
    - "Historical"
    - "Compliance"
```

## Security Testing

### Cloud Security Testing
- Configuration scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Penetration testing
- Compliance checking
- Security audit

### Security Tools
- AWS Security Hub
- Azure Security Center
- Google Security Command Center
- Cloud Custodian
- Prisma Cloud

## Incident Response

### Cloud Incident
```yaml
# cloud-incident.yml
response:
  - name: "Detection"
    actions:
      - "Monitor logs"
      - "Check metrics"
      - "Analyze events"
  - name: "Containment"
    actions:
      - "Isolate resources"
      - "Block access"
      - "Preserve evidence"
```

### Recovery
```yaml
# cloud-recovery.yml
recovery:
  - name: "Assessment"
    actions:
      - "Analyze impact"
      - "Check backups"
      - "Review logs"
  - name: "Restoration"
    actions:
      - "Restore data"
      - "Update security"
      - "Verify systems"
```

## Best Practices

### Cloud Security
- Use IAM best practices
- Implement network security
- Enable encryption
- Monitor resources
- Regular audits

### Cost Management
- Resource tagging
- Budget alerts
- Usage monitoring
- Cost optimization
- Regular review

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Cloud Security
```yaml
# multi-cloud.yml
security:
  identity:
    - "Single sign-on"
    - "Federation"
    - "MFA"
  network:
    - "VPN"
    - "Direct Connect"
    - "Peering"
  monitoring:
    - "Centralized"
    - "Real-time"
    - "Compliance"
```

### Serverless Security
```yaml
# serverless.yml
security:
  functions:
    - "Least privilege"
    - "Secure coding"
    - "Input validation"
  api:
    - "Authentication"
    - "Authorization"
    - "Rate limiting"
  data:
    - "Encryption"
    - "Access control"
    - "Audit logging"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Access problems
- Configuration errors
- Cost overruns
- Performance issues
- Compliance gaps

### Debugging
- Check logs
- Verify policies
- Test configurations
- Monitor metrics
- Review security
