# Security Fundamentals

## Introduction
Security Fundamentals is the foundation of security knowledge in DevOps, including basic concepts, principles, and practices to protect systems and data.

## Why Security Fundamentals?
- Data protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Risk mitigation
- Building trust
- Reputation protection

## Core Concepts

### CIA Triad
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

### Security Principles
- Defense in Depth
- Least Privilege
- Zero Trust
- Secure by Design
- Fail Securely

## Security Controls

### Physical Security
- Access control
- Environmental controls
- Surveillance
- Asset management
- Disaster recovery

### Technical Security
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Encryption
- Network security
- Application security

## Security Policies

### Access Control
```yaml
# access_policy.yml
policies:
  - name: "Least Privilege"
    description: "Users should have minimum required access"
    rules:
      - type: "role_based"
        roles: ["read", "write", "admin"]
      - type: "time_based"
        schedule: "9-5"
```

### Password Policy
```yaml
# password_policy.yml
requirements:
  min_length: 12
  require_uppercase: true
  require_lowercase: true
  require_numbers: true
  require_special: true
  max_age_days: 90
  history_count: 5
```

## Security Monitoring

### Logging
```yaml
# security_logging.yml
log_sources:
  - type: "authentication"
    level: "INFO"
    retention: "90d"
  - type: "authorization"
    level: "WARNING"
    retention: "180d"
  - type: "system"
    level: "ERROR"
    retention: "365d"
```

### Alerting
```yaml
# security_alerts.yml
alerts:
  - name: "Failed Login Attempts"
    condition: "count > 5 in 5m"
    severity: "HIGH"
    action: "notify_security_team"
  - name: "Unauthorized Access"
    condition: "access_denied"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    action: "block_ip"
```

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated scanning
- Manual testing
- Penetration testing
- Code review
- Security audit

### Security Tools
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)
- SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
- Container scanning

## Incident Response

### Response Plan
```yaml
# incident_response.yml
phases:
  - name: "Preparation"
    tasks:
      - "Define roles"
      - "Create procedures"
      - "Train team"
  - name: "Detection"
    tasks:
      - "Monitor systems"
      - "Analyze alerts"
      - "Verify incidents"
  - name: "Containment"
    tasks:
      - "Isolate systems"
      - "Block threats"
      - "Preserve evidence"
```

### Recovery
```yaml
# recovery_plan.yml
steps:
  - name: "Assessment"
    actions:
      - "Evaluate damage"
      - "Identify root cause"
      - "Plan recovery"
  - name: "Restoration"
    actions:
      - "Restore systems"
      - "Verify security"
      - "Monitor stability"
```

## Best Practices

### Security Hygiene
- Regular updates
- Patch management
- Configuration management
- Access review
- Security training

### Compliance
- Regular audits
- Documentation
- Policy review
- Risk assessment
- Incident reporting

## Common Use Cases

### Cloud Security
```yaml
# cloud_security.yml
controls:
  - type: "network"
    rules:
      - "VPC configuration"
      - "Security groups"
      - "Network ACLs"
  - type: "identity"
    rules:
      - "IAM policies"
      - "MFA"
      - "Role management"
```

### Container Security
```yaml
# container_security.yml
practices:
  - name: "Image Security"
    actions:
      - "Scan images"
      - "Sign images"
      - "Use trusted base"
  - name: "Runtime Security"
    actions:
      - "Limit capabilities"
      - "Network policies"
      - "Resource limits"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Access problems
- Configuration errors
- Policy conflicts
- Tool failures
- Compliance gaps

### Debugging
- Check logs
- Verify policies
- Test controls
- Review configurations
- Monitor alerts
