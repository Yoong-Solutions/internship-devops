# Security Automation

## Introduction
Security Automation is the process of automating security tasks to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure compliance in DevOps environments.

## Why Security Automation?
- Increased efficiency
- Reduced errors
- Ensured compliance
- Quick response
- Risk management

## Core Concepts

### Automation Tools
- CI/CD Security
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security Testing
- Compliance Checking
- Incident Response

### Automation Workflows
- Security Scanning
- Policy Enforcement
- Vulnerability Management
- Compliance Validation
- Security Monitoring

## Security Controls

### CI/CD Security
```yaml
# cicd-security.yml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: "Security Scan"
      tools:
        - "SAST"
        - "DAST"
        - "Container Scan"
    - name: "Compliance Check"
      tools:
        - "Policy Check"
        - "License Check"
        - "Vulnerability Check"
```

### Infrastructure Security
```yaml
# infra-security.yml
security:
  terraform:
    - "State encryption"
    - "Remote backend"
    - "Access control"
  kubernetes:
    - "Pod security"
    - "Network policies"
    - "RBAC"
```

## Security Policies

### Automated Policies
```yaml
# automated-policies.yml
policies:
  - name: "Code Security"
    rules:
      - "No secrets in code"
      - "Dependency check"
      - "Code quality"
  - name: "Infrastructure"
    rules:
      - "Security groups"
      - "IAM roles"
      - "Encryption"
```

### Compliance Rules
```yaml
# compliance-rules.yml
rules:
  - name: "Security Standards"
    checks:
      - "CIS benchmarks"
      - "NIST guidelines"
      - "Industry standards"
  - name: "Data Protection"
    checks:
      - "Encryption"
      - "Access control"
      - "Data privacy"
```

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
```yaml
# automated-monitoring.yml
monitoring:
  tools:
    - "Prometheus"
    - "Grafana"
    - "ELK Stack"
  alerts:
    - name: "Security Events"
      severity: "HIGH"
      action: "notify"
    - name: "Compliance"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      action: "report"
```

### Security Logging
```yaml
# security-logging.yml
logging:
  sources:
    - "Application logs"
    - "System logs"
    - "Security logs"
  analysis:
    - "Real-time"
    - "Automated"
    - "Compliance"
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing
- Compliance testing

### Security Tools
- OWASP ZAP
- SonarQube
- Trivy
- Snyk
- Aqua Security

## Incident Response

### Automated Response
```yaml
# automated-response.yml
response:
  - name: "Detection"
    actions:
      - "Log analysis"
      - "Alert generation"
      - "Initial assessment"
  - name: "Containment"
    actions:
      - "Resource isolation"
      - "Access blocking"
      - "Evidence collection"
```

### Recovery
```yaml
# automated-recovery.yml
recovery:
  - name: "Assessment"
    actions:
      - "Impact analysis"
      - "Root cause"
      - "Recovery plan"
  - name: "Restoration"
    actions:
      - "System restore"
      - "Security update"
      - "Verification"
```

## Best Practices

### Automation Best Practices
- Use version control
- Implement testing
- Monitor automation
- Regular updates
- Document processes

### Security Integration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security testing
- Compliance checking
- Incident response

## Common Use Cases

### DevSecOps Pipeline
```yaml
# devsecops.yml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: "Development"
      security:
        - "Code review"
        - "Static analysis"
        - "Unit testing"
    - name: "Build"
      security:
        - "Dependency check"
        - "Container scan"
        - "Artifact signing"
    - name: "Deploy"
      security:
        - "Infrastructure scan"
        - "Compliance check"
        - "Security validation"
```

### Security as Code
```yaml
# security-as-code.yml
security:
  policies:
    - "Infrastructure"
    - "Application"
    - "Data"
  tools:
    - "Policy as Code"
    - "Security as Code"
    - "Compliance as Code"
  automation:
    - "Testing"
    - "Deployment"
    - "Monitoring"
```

## Troubleshooting
