# Container Security

## Introduction
Container Security is a set of practices and tools to protect containers and containerized environments, including image security, runtime security, network security, and orchestration security.

## Why Container Security?
- Application protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Risk mitigation
- Environment security
- Vulnerability management

## Core Concepts

### Image Security
- Base image
- Image scanning
- Image signing
- Image registry
- Image layers

### Runtime Security
- Container isolation
- Resource limits
- Capabilities
- Seccomp profiles
- AppArmor/SELinux

## Security Controls

### Image Scanning
```yaml
# trivy-scan.yml
scanner:
  type: "trivy"
  image: "myapp:latest"
  severity: ["CRITICAL", "HIGH"]
  format: "json"
  output: "scan-results.json"
```

### Runtime Protection
```yaml
# runtime-security.yml
security:
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add: ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
  seccomp:
    profile: "runtime/default"
  apparmor:
    profile: "docker-default"
```

## Security Policies

### Image Policy
```yaml
# image-policy.yml
policies:
  - name: "Base Image"
    rules:
      - "Use official images"
      - "Pin versions"
      - "Regular updates"
  - name: "Vulnerabilities"
    rules:
      - "No critical issues"
      - "Max 5 high issues"
      - "Regular scanning"
```

### Runtime Policy
```yaml
# runtime-policy.yml
policies:
  - name: "Resource Limits"
    rules:
      - "CPU: 1 core"
      - "Memory: 512Mi"
      - "No privileged mode"
  - name: "Network"
    rules:
      - "No host network"
      - "Limited ports"
      - "Network policies"
```

## Security Monitoring

### Container Monitoring
```yaml
# container-monitoring.yml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - "CPU usage"
    - "Memory usage"
    - "Network traffic"
    - "File system"
  alerts:
    - name: "High CPU"
      threshold: "80%"
    - name: "Memory Limit"
      threshold: "90%"
```

### Security Logging
```yaml
# security-logging.yml
logging:
  drivers:
    - "json-file"
    - "syslog"
  retention: "7d"
  events:
    - "container_start"
    - "container_stop"
    - "security_events"
```

## Security Testing

### Container Scanning
- Image scanning
- Runtime scanning
- Network scanning
- Configuration scanning
- Compliance checking

### Security Tools
- Trivy
- Clair
- Anchore
- Falco
- Sysdig

## Incident Response

### Container Incident
```yaml
# container-incident.yml
response:
  - name: "Detection"
    actions:
      - "Monitor logs"
      - "Check metrics"
      - "Analyze behavior"
  - name: "Containment"
    actions:
      - "Stop container"
      - "Isolate network"
      - "Preserve evidence"
```

### Recovery
```yaml
# container-recovery.yml
recovery:
  - name: "Assessment"
    actions:
      - "Analyze logs"
      - "Check images"
      - "Review configs"
  - name: "Restoration"
    actions:
      - "Update images"
      - "Apply patches"
      - "Verify security"
```

## Best Practices

### Image Security
- Use minimal base images
- Regular updates
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Sign images
- Use multi-stage builds

### Runtime Security
- Limit capabilities
- Use read-only root
- Implement network policies
- Monitor resources
- Regular audits

## Common Use Cases

### Kubernetes Security
```yaml
# k8s-security.yml
policies:
  - name: "Pod Security"
    rules:
      - "No privileged containers"
      - "Read-only root filesystem"
      - "Run as non-root"
  - name: "Network Security"
    rules:
      - "Network policies"
      - "Service mesh"
      - "TLS encryption"
```

### Registry Security
```yaml
# registry-security.yml
security:
  authentication:
    type: "basic"
    realm: "Docker Registry"
  authorization:
    type: "rbac"
    roles:
      - "reader"
      - "writer"
      - "admin"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Image vulnerabilities
- Runtime errors
- Network problems
- Resource limits
- Policy violations

### Debugging
- Check logs
- Verify policies
- Test configurations
- Monitor metrics
- Review security
