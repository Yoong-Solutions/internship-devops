# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

## Overview
This module covers Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, a powerful tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Infrastructure as Code concepts
- Master Terraform basics and advanced features
- Learn module development and reuse
- Implement infrastructure best practices

## POC 4.1: Terraform Basics

### Prerequisites
