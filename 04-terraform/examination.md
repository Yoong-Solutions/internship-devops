# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform - Examination

## POC Inheritance
This POC builds upon:
- Linux system administration (POC 1.1)
- Docker container management (POC 2.1)
- CI/CD automation (POC 3.1)
And will be used as a foundation for:
- Kubernetes infrastructure (POC 5.1)
- Monitoring infrastructure (POC 6.1)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-Environment Infrastructure
Create a Terraform project that integrates with previous POCs:
- Manages multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Implements reusable modules
- Uses remote state
- Implements state locking
- Manages sensitive data
- Implements proper tagging
- Follows naming conventions

This infrastructure will be used as a base for:
- Kubernetes cluster infrastructure in POC 5.1
- Monitoring system infrastructure in POC 6.1

### Exercise 2: Complex Infrastructure Setup
Implement a complex infrastructure that extends the container setup from POC 2.2:
- Sets up VPC and networking
- Configures security groups
- Manages compute resources
- Implements load balancing
- Sets up database infrastructure
- Configures monitoring
- Implements backup solutions

This setup will be expanded for:
- Kubernetes cluster deployment in POC 5.2
- Monitoring system deployment in POC 6.2

### Exercise 3: CI/CD Integration
Create a CI/CD pipeline that builds upon POC 3.1:
- Validates Terraform code
- Implements plan/apply workflow
- Manages state changes
- Implements drift detection
- Handles rollbacks
- Manages secrets
- Generates documentation

This pipeline will be extended for:
- Kubernetes deployment automation in POC 5.2
- Monitoring system deployment in POC 6.2

## Assessment Criteria

### Knowledge Assessment
1. Terraform concepts understanding
2. Infrastructure as Code principles
3. Cloud provider knowledge
4. Security best practices

### Practical Assessment
1. Code organization

3. State management
4. Security implementation

### Documentation Requirements
1. Architecture diagrams
2. Module documentation
3. Deployment procedures
4. Security measures
5. Integration with previous and future POCs

## Submission Guidelines
1. All Terraform code must be well-documented
2. Include setup instructions
3. Provide test cases
4. Document any assumptions made
5. Document how the solution integrates with previous POCs and prepares for future ones

## Grading Rubric
