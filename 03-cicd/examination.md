# CI/CD with GitHub Actions - Examination

## POC Inheritance
This POC builds upon:
- Linux automation skills (POC 1.1)
- Docker containerization (POC 2.1)
And will be used as a foundation for:
- Infrastructure automation (POC 4.1)
- Kubernetes deployment automation (POC 5.1)
- Monitoring system deployment (POC 6.1)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic CI Pipeline
Implement a CI pipeline that extends the automation from POC 1.1 and containerization from POC 2.1:
- Runs automated tests
- Performs code quality checks
- Generates build artifacts
- Implements caching
- Handles different environments
- Manages dependencies
- Reports test coverage

This pipeline will be used as a base for:
- Infrastructure CI in POC 4.1
- Kubernetes deployment CI in POC 5.1
- Monitoring system CI in POC 6.1

### Exercise 2: CD Pipeline
Create a CD pipeline that builds upon the deployment concepts from POC 2.2:
- Deploys to staging environment
- Implements blue-green deployment
- Manages environment variables
- Handles database migrations
- Implements rollback strategy
- Monitors deployment health
- Sends deployment notifications

This pipeline will be extended for:
- Infrastructure deployment in POC 4.2
- Kubernetes deployment in POC 5.2
- Monitoring system deployment in POC 6.2

### Exercise 3: Security and Compliance
Set up security measures that integrate with security implementations from POC 1.1 and 2.2:
- Implements secret management
- Performs security scanning
- Enforces code signing
- Manages access control
- Implements compliance checks
- Generates security reports
- Handles vulnerability fixes

This security framework will be expanded in:
- Infrastructure security (POC 4.2)
- Kubernetes security (POC 5.2)
- Monitoring security (POC 6.2)
