# Kubernetes - Examination

## POC Inheritance
This POC builds upon:
- Linux system administration (POC 1.1)
- Docker container management (POC 2.1)
- CI/CD automation (POC 3.1)
- Infrastructure as Code (POC 4.1)
And will be used as a foundation for:
- Monitoring and logging in Kubernetes (POC 6.1)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-Tier Application Deployment
Deploy a complex application that integrates with previous POCs:
- Uses multiple containers (from POC 2.1)
- Implements proper networking (from POC 4.1)
- Manages persistent storage
- Implements health checks
- Uses ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Implements proper resource limits
- Follows best practices

This deployment will be used as a base for:
- Monitoring system deployment in POC 6.1
- Logging system deployment in POC 6.2

### Exercise 2: Advanced Kubernetes Features
Implement advanced features that extend previous POCs:
- Set up Ingress controllers
- Implement service mesh
- Configure network policies
- Set up RBAC
- Implement pod security policies
- Configure resource quotas
- Set up horizontal pod autoscaling

These features will be integrated with:
- Infrastructure security from POC 4.2
- CI/CD security from POC 3.2
- Monitoring security in POC 6.2

### Exercise 3: Monitoring and Maintenance
Create a monitoring system that builds upon POC 1.1, 2.2, and 4.2:
- Implements Prometheus monitoring
- Sets up Grafana dashboards
- Configures alerting
- Implements logging
- Sets up backup solutions
- Implements disaster recovery
- Manages cluster updates

This system will be expanded in:
- Comprehensive monitoring in POC 6.1
- Advanced logging in POC 6.2

## Assessment Criteria
