# Monitoring and Logging - Examination

## POC Inheritance
This POC is the culmination of all previous POCs, building upon:
- Linux system monitoring (POC 1.1)
- Container monitoring (POC 2.2)
- CI/CD monitoring (POC 3.2)
- Infrastructure monitoring (POC 4.2)
- Kubernetes monitoring (POC 5.2)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Monitoring Setup
Implement a basic monitoring system that integrates all previous monitoring implementations:
- Sets up Prometheus
- Configures basic metrics collection
- Creates Grafana dashboards
- Implements basic alerting
- Monitors system resources
- Tracks application metrics
- Implements service discovery

This system combines monitoring from:
- Linux system monitoring (POC 1.1)
- Container monitoring (POC 2.2)
- CI/CD monitoring (POC 3.2)
- Infrastructure monitoring (POC 4.2)
- Kubernetes monitoring (POC 5.2)

### Exercise 2: Advanced Monitoring
Create an advanced monitoring solution that extends previous implementations:
- Implements custom metrics
- Sets up complex alerting rules
- Creates advanced dashboards
- Implements metric aggregation
- Sets up long-term storage
- Configures high availability
- Implements backup solutions

This solution integrates with:
- Infrastructure monitoring from POC 4.2
- Kubernetes monitoring from POC 5.2
- Security monitoring from all previous POCs

### Exercise 3: Logging System
Implement a comprehensive logging system that consolidates logging from all previous POCs:
- Sets up ELK stack
- Configures log collection
- Implements log parsing
- Creates log visualizations
- Sets up log retention
- Implements log security
- Configures log shipping

This system aggregates logs from:
- Linux system logs (POC 1.1)
- Container logs (POC 2.2)
- CI/CD logs (POC 3.2)
- Infrastructure logs (POC 4.2)
- Kubernetes logs (POC 5.2)
