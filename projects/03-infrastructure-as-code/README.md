# Project 3: Infrastructure as Code

## Objective
Use Terraform to automate the creation and management of infrastructure on cloud platforms, applying best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Requirements
- Cloud account (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Terraform installed
- Basic knowledge of cloud services
- Understanding of networking and security

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Install Terraform
- Configure cloud provider credentials
- Set up version control
- Install required tools:
  - AWS CLI/GCP CLI/Azure CLI
  - Git
  - IDE with Terraform support

### 2. Design Infrastructure
- Analyze requirements
- Design architecture
- Select cloud services
- Plan deployment

### 3. Write Terraform Code
- Create module structure
- Write resource definitions
- Configure variables and outputs
- Apply best practices:
  - State management
  - Remote state
  - Workspaces
  - Modules

### 4. State and Secrets Management
- Configure remote state
- Manage sensitive data
- Use data sources
- Backup and versioning

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Write unit tests
- Use Terratest
- Validate configurations
- Security scanning
