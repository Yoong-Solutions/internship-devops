# Docker and Containers - Examination

## POC Inheritance
This POC builds upon Linux basics (POC 1.1) and will be used as a foundation for:
- CI/CD pipeline containerization (POC 3.1)
- Infrastructure container management (POC 4.1)
- Kubernetes container orchestration (POC 5.1)
- Container monitoring and logging (POC 6.1)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-container Web Application
Create a containerized web application that extends the Linux system administration skills from POC 1.1:
- Frontend container (React/Node.js)
- Backend container (Python/Java)
- Database container (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Docker Compose configuration
- Environment variable management
- Volume management for persistent data

This application will be used as a base for:
- CI/CD pipeline testing in POC 3.1
- Infrastructure deployment in POC 4.1
- Kubernetes deployment in POC 5.1
- Monitoring implementation in POC 6.1

### Exercise 2: CI/CD Pipeline for Docker
Implement a CI/CD pipeline that prepares for POC 3.1:
- Builds Docker images automatically
- Runs tests in containers
- Pushes images to Docker Hub
- Deploys to staging environment
- Implements rollback strategy
- Includes security scanning
- Manages secrets properly

This pipeline will be extended in:
- GitHub Actions workflows (POC 3.1)
- Infrastructure deployment (POC 4.1)
- Kubernetes deployment (POC 5.1)
- Monitoring deployment (POC 6.1)

### Exercise 3: Container Monitoring System
Set up a monitoring system that builds upon POC 1.1 monitoring:
- Tracks container resource usage
- Monitors container health
- Implements logging solution
- Sets up alerts for issues
- Creates Grafana dashboards
- Implements log rotation
- Handles container crashes

This system will be expanded in:
- CI/CD monitoring (POC 3.2)
- Infrastructure monitoring (POC 4.2)
- Kubernetes monitoring (POC 5.2)
- Comprehensive monitoring (POC 6.2)
